`musketon` gives you full control of who you grant access to your most personal data. You can authorize third parties to access specific data points about you, set an access expiry moment, arbitrarily decide to revoke access and follow an audit trail of when and why granted third parties accessed your data. 

You could grant:

* shipping couriers access to your name and home address
* social networks access to your name and birthday
* the municipality access to your name, birthdate, gender and home address
* hotels access to your name, credit card number and dietary preferences
* flight companies access to your name and passport number
* the tax collection agency access to your bank account and crypto wallet addresses
* your landlord and real estate agent access to your name, salary payslip and employment contract
* ....many, many more use cases

Feeling like there's a third party that does not need your data anymore? You just revoke their access.

`musketon` is a dApp, powered by the [NEO](https://neo.org/) blockchain. 

For more information, have a look at the [README](https://github.com/musketon/musketon).
